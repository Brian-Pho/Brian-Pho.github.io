			As of 2023, I'm 25 years old and I've chosen to dedicate my life towards pursuing scientific greatness. My life's goal is
			to become one of the world's greatest neuroscientists by creating a Theory of Consciousness and inventing a neuromorphic chip.
			My journey started in 2015 when I came across the idea of artificial general intelligence (AGI), leading me to pursue software engineering.
			Over the years, however, I've drifted away from the computer science aspect of AGI as I learned more about the brain.
			During my internship in 2018, I read my first neuroscience textbook and my love of learning about the brain has only grown since. I've
			since completed my masters in neuroscience (completely unrelated to my personal neuroscience research) and I (try to) spend one hour
			every day learning more about the brain. This means reading neuroscience books, papers, textbook, and online articles. Somewhere along the
			way, I changed my goal from creating AGI to better understanding the brain. Don't get me wrong though, I still want to create AGI but I
			will pursue it by building neuromorphic chips. I also want to tackle the problem of consciousness since I think I have a good attack
			on it, but only the future knows if I'm right or if it's just ramblings of an amateur scientist.

			Aside from my ambitions, I live a quiet but busy life. I have so many hobbies haha. I read many books, mainly science fiction 
			(The Three Body Problem series), fantasy (Mistborn series), and pop neuroscience books. I occasionally play video games, mostly with
			friends such as League of Legends, or solo games like Civilization V and XCOM 2. I also watch many TV shows (Person of Interest),
			anime (From the New World), and movies. For exercise, I run at a high intensity on the treadmill and play badminton every week. I 
			used to swim but my skills have since decayed to the level of a frog. I still build computers for family and friends and handle everything IT like 
			setting up WiFi and being into mechanical keyboards (I currently rock Gazzew Boba U4s). I follow the Canadian Couch Potato strategy for
			investing by buying VGRO but I do understand the fundamentals like what a stock is and the difference between mutual fund, index fund, and
			ETF. I've put many of my friends on ETFs but sadly, most of them don't follow through by maxing out their TFSA/RRSP/FHSA. Ever since owning
			a car, I've become a DIY mechanic. For instance, I change my own engine oil, brakes, and transmission fluid. I don't do anything
			complex but most of the basic repairs I can do. I do some cooking, some house repairs, and a seedling amount of gardening. I do have a peculiar
			habit of listening to about 10 new EDM songs every day for the past 10 years so I've accumulated a massive EDM library and have listened
			to over 15,000 unique songs (even more if I count the unsaved songs). So I do consider myself an EDM aficionado.
