		<h2>ENSF 480: Bug Tracking System (Nov 2017)</h2>
		<p><a href="https://github.com/Brian-Pho/ENSF480_Bug-Tracking-System">Source Code</a></p>
		<p>
			This project was done in a group of three where the goal was to create a bug tracking system using a software engineering
			design methodology. Due to the nature of being in school, we only had time to do a simple linear development process which has
			an analysis, design, and implementation phase. The analysis phase included creating a use-case diagram, sequence diagram, and activity diagram
			for obtaining a high level overview of the functional requirements and constraints. The design phase then moved onto more detailed 
			diagrams such as a UML class diagram, deployment diagram, and state transition diagram for a bug. Lastly, the project was implemented
			in Java where Git and IntelliJ were used to code the project.
		</p>
		<p>
			The project is a system used by developers and managers for tracking software bugs reported by users. A user is able to submit a 
			bug report that is then approved by the manager. Once the manager approves/disapproves of the bug, it is then assigned to a developer
			to be fixed. When the bug is fixed, the developer marks the bug as fixed and carries on. This project did not require the use of a database
			so a simple text file was used.
		</p>
		<p>
			From this project I learned how a software engineer might go through the process of developing a good piece of software. It was interesting 
			how the initial analysis and design phases made it easier to implement the program afterwards as most of the thinking had been done during 
			those two phases. The implementation just required converting the diagrams into code which isn't too bad. I had some fun times during the project
			such as implementing a singleton design pattern for the login and creating the GUIs.

		<h2>Personal: Github Pages Website (July 2017)</h2>
		<p><a href="https://github.com/Brian-Pho/Brian-Pho.github.io">Source Code</a></p>
		<p>
			This website, the one you're reading this on, is a personal project of mine that I
			made from scratch over my summer break. I wanted to make a website for multiple reasons. The first reason was
			to learn a new programming language (HTML and CSS in this case) and apply it immediately.
			Second was because I am going to be applying for internships soon and having a website
			is useful in showcasing my past projects and info about me. The last reason was because I love
			programming and find it fun!
		</p>
		<p>
			This is the first time I've programmed in HTML and it's
			different from the Java and C programming that I'd previously done. HTML is similar
			to LaTeX, a language used for note taking, so I learned it quickly. I also owe my knowledge to
			the textbook <i>HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</i> by Jon Duckett. I read this 
			textbook to learn HTML and it made HTML and CSS easy for me to understand.
			This website is currently hosted using Github Pages. The header 
			font is Open Sans and the text font is Roboto which are provided by Google Fonts.

		<h2>CPSC 471: Library Database Management System (June 2017)</h2>
		<p><a href="https://github.com/Brian-Pho/CPSC471_Library-App">Source Code</a></p>
		<p>
			While this project was part of my database class, it can be thought of as
			a continuation and combination of my last two projects. This project was
			done in a group of three and I was assigned to do the UI aspect of the app. For this project,
			my group had to create an app that connected to a database (mySQL) and retrieve
			data from the database using SQL queries. This project was challenging because the project
			required the use of multiple programming languages (Java, SQL, PHP, and XML) and required the
			use of an external server to host the data.
		</p>
		<p>
			The purpose of this project was to allow library users access to the library database from the
			app. Their are two different users, users and admins, with admins having additional 
			functionalities. Their were a lot of functions that we had to incorporate such as
			search, add, delete, and update which increased the complexity of the project. 
			Overall, this project was very challenging but I learned a lot from it.

		<h2>ENSF 409: Airlines Registration (April 2017)</h2>
		<p><a href="https://github.com/Brian-Pho/ENSF409_Airlines-Registration-System">Source Code</a></p>
		<p>
			This was my first project that involved the use of a database (mySQL). This project was
			done in a group of three where I had the role of designing the UI for
			the program. The UI was built using Java and IntelliJ. The purpose of this 
			program was to connect to an external database and relay
			information back and forth from the client and server. 
		</p>
		<p>
			There are two different types of users, clients and admins, both of which have different 
			functionalities. The program allows users to book a flight and view the current flights 
			to and from there destination. Only admins are able to add and view all tickets.

		<h2>ENSF 409: Calculator Android App (March 2017)</h2>
		<p><a href="https://github.com/Brian-Pho/ENSF409_Calculator">Source Code</a></p>
		<p>
			A generic calculator app for Android. This was my first experience working
			with Android Studio and Java. There were many small quirks that we had to
			incorporate such as division by zero, holding the previous operation, and
			chaining operations.

		<h2>ENGG 233: Ring Runner Game (December 2015)</h2>
		<p><a href="https://github.com/Brian-Pho/ENGG233_Ring-Runner-Game">Source Code</a></p>
		<p>
			My first major project after taking my first programming course. 
			The project I chose to do was an original game programmed in 
			Processing; a language based on Java. A notable problem that I had to
			solve when developing the game was trying to make the ball move in a
			circular path. The solution was to use sin and cos for the y and x coordinates
			of the ball. This solution made sense as the unit circle is described by trigonometric
			functions.
