			The following are projects that I have been involved in. The list is ordered with the most recent project
			at the top. By ordering the projects chronologically, the progress I've made can be seen. Most of the
			projects have been a part of school but this website is a personal endeavor. My GitHub can be found
			<a href="https://github.com/Brian-Pho"> here</a>.

			<h2>Personal: Github Pages Website</h2>
			<p><a href="https://github.com/Brian-Pho/Brian-Pho.github.io">Source Code</a></p>
			<p>
				This website, the one you're reading this on, is a personal project of mine that I
				made over my summer break. I wanted to make a website for multiple reasons. The first reason was
				to learn a new programming language (HTML and CSS in this case) and apply it immediately.
				Second was because I am going to be applying for internships soon and having a website
				is useful in showcasing my past projects and info about me. Lastly was because I love
				programming and find it fun!
			</p>
			<p>
				This is the first time I've programmed in HTML and it's very
				different from the Java and C programming that I'd previously done. HTML is very similar
				to LaTeX, a language used for note taking, so I learned it quickly. I also owe my knowledge to
				the textbook <i>HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</i> by Jon Duckett. I read this 
				textbook to learn HTML and it made it really easy for me to understand the concepts.
				This website is currently hosted using Github Pages. The header 
				font is Open Sans and the text font is Roboto which are provided by Google Fonts.

			<h2>CPSC 471: Library Database Management System</h2>
			<p><a href="https://github.com/Brian-Pho/Library-App">Source Code</a></p>
			<p>
				While this project was part of my database class, it can be thought of as
				a continuation and combination of my last two projects. This project was
				done in a group of three and I was assigned to do the UI aspect of the app. For this project,
				my group had to create an app that connected to a database (mySQL) and retrieve
				data from the database using SQL queries. This project was challenging because the project
				required the use of multiple programming languages (Java, SQL, PHP, and XML) and required the
				use of an external server to host the data.
			</p>
			<p>
				The purpose of this project was to allow library users access to the library database from the
				app. Their are two different users, users and admins, with admins having additional 
				functionalities. Their were a lot of functions that we had to incorporate such as
				search, add, delete, and update which increased the complexity of the project. 
				Overall, this project was very challenging but I learned a lot from it.

			<h2>ENSF 409: Airlines Registration</h2>
			<p><a href="https://github.com/Sadat21/AirlinesRegistrationSystem">Source Code</a></p>
			<p>
				This was my first project that involved the use of a database. This project was
				done in a group of three where I had the role of designing the UI for
				the program. The UI was built using Java and IntelliJ. The purpose of this 
				program was to connect to an external database (mySQL in this case) and relay
				information back and forth from the client and server. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There are two different types of users, clients and admins, both of which have different 
				functionalities. The program allows users to book a flight and view the current flights 
				to and from there destination. Only admins are able to add and view all tickets.

			<h2>ENSF 409: Calculator Android App</h2>
			<p><a href="https://github.com/Sadat21/Calculator">Source Code</a></p>
			<p>
				A generic calculator app for Android. This was my first experience working
				with Android Studio and Java. There were many small quirks that we had to
				incorporate such as division by zero, holding the previous operation, and
				chaining operations.

			<h2>ENGG 233: Ring Runner Game</h2>
			<p><a href="https://github.com/Brian-Pho/Ring-Runner-Game">Source Code</a></p>
			<p>
				My first major project after taking my first programming course in first year
				engineering. The project I chose to do was an original game programmed in 
				Processing; a language based on Java. A notable problem that I had to
				solve when developing the game was trying to make the ball move in a
				circular path. The solution was to use sin and cos for the y and x coordinates
				of the ball. This solution made sense as the unit circle is described by trigonometric
				functions.
